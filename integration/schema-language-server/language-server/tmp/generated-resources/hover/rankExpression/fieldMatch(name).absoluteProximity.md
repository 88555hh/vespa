Returns the normalized proximity of the matched terms, weighted by the connectedness of the query terms. This number is 0.1 if all the matched terms are and have default or lower connectedness, close to 1 if they are following in sequence and have a high connectedness, and close to 0 if they are far from each other in the segments or out of order.

Default: 0
