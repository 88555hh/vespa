The euclidian distance from the query position to the given position attribute in millionths of degrees (about 10 cm). If there are multiple positions in the query, items that actually search in *name* is preferred. Also: if multiple query items search in *name* , or *name* is an array of positions, or both, the closest distance found is returned.
