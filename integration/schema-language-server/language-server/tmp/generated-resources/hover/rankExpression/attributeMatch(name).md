A normalized measure of the degree to which this query and field matched. This is currently the same as completeness. Note that depending on what the attribute is used for, this may or may not be a suitable metric. If the attribute is a weighted set representing counts of items (like tags), `normalizedWeight` is probably a better metric.

Default: 0
