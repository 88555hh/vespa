Returns a normalized measure of the number of occurrences of the terms of the query. This is 1 if there are many occurrences of the query terms *in absolute terms, or relative to the total content of the field*, and 0 if there are none.

This is suitable for occurrence in fields containing regular text.

Default: 0
