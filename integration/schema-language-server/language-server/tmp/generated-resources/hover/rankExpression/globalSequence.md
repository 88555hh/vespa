A global sequence number computed as (1 \<\< 48) - (LocalDocumentId \<\< 16 \|\| [distribution-key](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services-content.html#node)). This will give a global sequence to documents. This is a cheap way of having stable ordering of documents. Note the large range of this value. Also note that if the system is not stable, e.g. if documents move around due to new nodes coming in, or nodes being removed, it will no longer be stable as documents might be found in a different replica. If you need true global ordering we suggest assigning a unique numeric id to your documents as an [attribute](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#attribute) field and use the [attribute(name)](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/rank-features.html#attribute(name)) feature.

Default: n/a
